## Features and Security of OKX Web3 Wallet

### Multi-Chain Support for Better Asset Management

OKX Web3 Wallet supports over 80 blockchain networks, including Ethereum, Polygon, and Solana, without requiring additional RPC setup. Users can create multiple seed phrases and derive multiple accounts from a single seed. The wallet provides an intuitive interface for managing all supported assets, including cryptocurrencies and NFTs.

### MPC Wallet: Private-Key-Free Technology

The wallet features an innovative MPC (Multi-Party Computation) technology, which eliminates the need for private keys. Key features include:

2. **User-Friendly Experience:** Eliminates the need for private key or seed phrase management, making Web3 accessible to newcomers.
3. **Cost-Effective Recovery:** If a portion of the private key is lost or stolen, the wallet can generate new shares to replace the lost ones, nullifying any risks.
4. **Emergency Backup:** Users can export their private keys using two self-managed fragments in emergencies, ensuring true decentralization.

This unique approach makes OKX Wallet a secure and user-friendly choice, especially for those new to Web3.
