## Step 1: Register on a Cryptocurrency Exchange

### Local Cryptocurrency Exchange

To buy cryptocurrency, you first need to deposit funds (fiat currency) into a cryptocurrency exchange. Most international exchanges donâ€™t support TWD (New Taiwan Dollar), so you need to use a local exchange that does.  
Some popular and legal options in Taiwan include:

- **[MAX](https://newplayerjino.com/max-tutorial/)**
- **[BitoPro](https://www.bitopro.com/users/sign_up?referrer=4030615841)**

Among these, BitoPro is recommended for its user-friendly interface and versatile features.

> **Pro Tip:** If youâ€™re unsure which to choose, just go with BitoPro!

### International Cryptocurrency Exchange

Once youâ€™ve registered on a local exchange, the next step is to register on a global cryptocurrency exchange for broader access to cryptocurrencies and better liquidity.

#### How to Choose an Exchange?
1. **Ranked Exchanges:** Use trusted sites like [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/zh-tw/rankings/exchanges/) to check rankings. High-ranking exchanges typically have better security and higher trading volume.
2. **Features and Tools:** Choose exchanges with diverse tools and promotions, such as savings accounts or trading campaigns.

Popular global exchanges include **[Binance](https://www.binance.com/join?ref=OAJCIZED)** and **[OKX](https://bit.ly/OKXe)**. OKX, in particular, offers competitive transaction fees and numerous features for new traders.

## Step 2: Complete KYC Verification

Completing KYC verification may take anywhere from minutes to days, depending on the exchange. For example:

- **Local Exchanges:** MAX can take up to 1â€“2 days, while BitoPro is quicker, often completing verification within 10 minutes.
- **International Exchanges:** OKX or Bybit typically complete KYC in under 10 minutes.

> **What is KYC?**  
> KYC ensures that the account belongs to the person registering. It helps prevent illegal activities like money laundering or identity theft. Typically, youâ€™ll need to upload identification documents (e.g., ID cards or passports).

---

## Step 3: Deposit Funds

After completing KYC, link your Taiwanese bank account to deposit TWD into your local cryptocurrency exchange. For example:

- **MAX:** Bank verification may take 2 days or more.
- **BitoPro:** Usually completed within a day.

Once verified, deposit funds into your exchange account using the account number provided by the exchange. This process is similar to a standard bank transfer.

---

## Step 4: Buy USDT (Tether)

Once you have TWD in your local exchange, the next step is to buy **USDT**, a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar.

### Why USDT?
USDT offers high liquidity and price stability, making it a convenient intermediary currency for buying other cryptocurrencies.

1. Open the trading section on your exchange.
2. Look for the **USDT/TWD** trading pair.
3. Choose to buy at either the **market price** (for immediate purchase) or **limit price** (to specify your buying price).

USDT allows for easier and safer transfers to international exchanges and eliminates the need to constantly convert back to fiat currency.

---

## Step 5: Transfer to Another Exchange

Now that you have USDT, you can transfer it to an international exchange to access more cryptocurrency options. Hereâ€™s how:

1. On the receiving exchange, select **Deposit** and choose **USDT**.
2. Select the transfer network (usually **TRC-20**, unless otherwise specified).
3. Copy the wallet address provided by the receiving exchange.
4. On your local exchange, choose **Withdraw** or **Send**, paste the wallet address, and specify the transfer amount.
5. Confirm and transfer.

> **Tip:** For first-time transfers, send a small amount to ensure everything is correct before transferring the full amount.

---

## Step 6: Buy Cryptocurrency

Once your funds arrive at the international exchange, search for the cryptocurrency you want to buy (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) and complete the purchase.

---

## Participate in Exchange Promotions

Cryptocurrency exchanges often run promotions and offer tools like:

- **Savings Accounts**
- **Staking**
- **Grid Trading**
- **Launchpads**
- **Liquidity Mining**

For beginners, low-risk tools like savings accounts or staking are excellent starting points. Launchpads are also highly recommended for potentially high returns with minimal risk.
