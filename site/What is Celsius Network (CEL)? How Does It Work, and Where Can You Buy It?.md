## How Does Celsius Network (CEL) Work?

Celsius Network operates as a blockchain-based protocol providing services similar to traditional financial institutions such as banks. The platformâ€™s native token, **CEL**, is both a utility and governance token, playing a vital role in the rewards distribution and eligibility within the Celsius ecosystem.

### Key Features:
- **Revenue Redistribution:** Unlike traditional financial institutions, Celsius redistributes 80% of its revenue back to its users in the form of higher yields, interest payments, and token rewards.
- **Overcollateralized Loans:** The platform enables users to lend or borrow cryptocurrency using assets as collateral. Large institutional investors access liquidity through Celsius, while users benefit from attractive rates and rewards.
- **Tier-Based Rewards:** Users can earn higher interest and reduced loan rates depending on the percentage of CEL tokens in their portfolio.

Celsius also supports a variety of cryptocurrencies, paying interest in the same asset or in CEL tokens. For example, users holding DOT earn rewards in DOT, and users holding AVAX earn AVAX rewards.
