## How Does IOST Work?

IOST, short for "Internet of Services Token," is a blockchain that provides fast and secure transactions, pioneering blockchain payments and online services. It employs a unique consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Believability (PoB) to achieve high scalability and efficiency.

The IOST token is essential to the network, functioning similarly to how ETH powers the Ethereum network. Developers use IOST to build decentralized applications (dApps) while benefiting from reduced development costs and access to tools provided by the platform.

Notably, IOST launched its mainnet in 2019, offering a more efficient, affordable, and stable smart contract environment compared to Ethereum. Its network supports up to 100,000 transactions per second (TPS), with transaction confirmation times under 0.5 seconds, making it highly scalable for real-world applications.

## What Is IOST Used For?

The primary role of IOST is to maintain the security and privacy of its network. IOST tokens are used to pay transaction fees and serve as the main currency within its ecosystem. Developers can stake IOST tokens to access resources needed for building dApps.

Additionally, IOST facilitates decentralized finance (DeFi) products, allowing users to earn rewards through staking and liquidity pools. Its developer-friendly structure supports JavaScript, making it easier for traditional Web2 developers to transition into blockchain.

## Where to Buy IOST Tokens?

IOST tokens can be purchased on major centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. To buy IOST:
1. Deposit fiat currency into an exchange.
2. Trade for IOST tokens, which will be stored in your digital wallet on the platform.

Popular exchanges for trading IOST include:
- Binance
- OKX
- KuCoin

To ensure full control of your assets, transfer IOST tokens to a private wallet. This enables secure access to decentralized platforms and DeFi products.

## History and Milestones of IOST

### When Was IOST Launched?

IOST was introduced in 2017 following its token sale, where the price was set at 1 IOST = $0.01. Since its listing on global exchanges, IOST has become one of the most popular blockchains, addressing the growing demand for scalability and security.

### What Are the Controversies Surrounding IOST?

As with many blockchain projects, IOST faces scrutiny due to its high token supply. A large supply can deter investors, as it suggests a lack of scarcity. Furthermore, its low circulating supply poses potential risks, as a sudden influx of tokens could lead to negative price actions.
